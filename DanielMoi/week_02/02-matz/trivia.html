        <h1>Trivia!</h1>
        <p>
          Matz has written a few books, including 'Ruby in a Nutshell', because he knows Ruby fairly well.
        </p>
        <p>Matz's favourite language is Lisp. He considers it the ancestor for every good language.</p>
        <p>Matz has recently studied the Lua language from Brazil. He says it shares a lot with the small dialect of Ruby.</p>
        <p>Semi-confessionally, he considers himself a language geek.</p>

          <p>Matz's favourite Marx brother is Groucho.</p>
          <p>That may not ncessarily be true.</p>
          <p>Probability that Joel didn't know that Matz has studied Lua: 60%.</p>
