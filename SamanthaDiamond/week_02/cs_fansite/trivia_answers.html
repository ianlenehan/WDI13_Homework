    <h1>Richard M. Stallman</h1>
    <h2>Why Joel admires Richard</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>He loves butterflies</li>
      <li>He is anti-facebook</li>
      <li>He advocates for free struff</li>
      <li>He showers by running <i>make clean</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How much does Joel really know about Richard???</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>What are his favourite Programming Languages? </li>
        C and Lisp

      <li>Stallman uses the concept of "Copyleft" to ensure freedom to all users? What does he mean by copyleft?</li>
        Copyleft says that anyone who redistributes the software, with or without changes, must pass along the freedom to further copy and change it. Copyleft guarantees that every user has freedom.

      <li>What is his favourite food?</li>
        "...there are many ways for something to be good, and they cannot be compared and ordered. I can't judge whether I like chocolate better or noodles better, because I like them in different ways. Thus, I cannot determine which food is my favorite."

      <li>In 1990 Stallman won a prestigious grant, what was it?</li>
        MacArthur Genius Grant

      <li>BONUS Question: what was the best thing about winning this grant for Richard?</li>
        He was living in his office and prior to winning this prize he wasn't allowed to vote as his office wasn't an accepted address. A newspaper article about the MacArthur grant said that and then they let me register.
        <!-- It made it easier for me to register to vote. I was living in my office and they didn’t want to accept that as my address. A newspaper article about the MacArthur grant said that and then they let me register. The money didn’t make a revolutionary difference; it meant I no longer had to consult for money.
I live very cheaply. I basically still live like a student. Because I never wanted to stop. Cars, big houses have no appeal to me. No appeal at all. I wasn’t a slave of appetite for money, and that enabled me to do something worth doing. That’s why, when I started the GNU project, I also started growing my hair. I did that because I wanted to say I’d come to agree with one aspect of hippie movement: don’t focus on material success as a goal in life. -->
