      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Richard Stallman (often referred to as rms), was born in New York in 1953. His mother was a substitute teacher and his father was in the printing business.
        Stallman had a great aptitude for mathematics and science at a young age, learning calculus as early as 7 years old. His hunger for knowledge and inability
        to "get along with people in the usual ways", cast him as an outsider. He was deeply adverse to competition and would refuse to take part in some quiz's.
        He was constantly moved between private and public schools, leaving a trail of disciplinary problems in his wake.

        In his early teens he discovered computer programming by reading user manuals and landed a gig as a lab assistant at a biology lab at Rockefeller University.
        He then got involved with the IBM New
        York Scientific Center, where he began programming "actual" computers. After graduating highschool, sneakerly skipping a grade in the process, he enrolled
        in mathematics and physics at Harvard. At the end of Stallman's freshman year, he started working at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, which was founded
        by DARPA [the Defense Department's Advanced Projects Agency]. There Stallman "became part of the software-sharing community that had existed for many years."

        Stallman became the founding father of software sharing and would openly preach against "evil" proprietary software. He took on the role of an Old Testament Prophet,
        preaching about the beauty of "free" software (it has been rumoured that a certain incedent with a printer drove him to this level of uncompromised moral values).
        In 1982, Stallman embarked on the mission to develop a free and completely nonpropeitary operating system similar to UNIX. In true computer science humour he created
        a recursive acronym for the new operating system GNU (GNU's Not UNUX). The meaning of free software is often missed, think "free speech" not "free beer".
        Long live free software!
